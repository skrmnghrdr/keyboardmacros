The C file in this folder is to be replaced on wherever that keymap.c lives, 
we also have delted the process_record_user() on keyboard.h or c, whichever to fix the error and let it compile

DO NOT FORGET TO ENABLE YOUR SELECT ALL MACROS ON THE VIA since control a is replaced.
This is similar to the macros found on 
https://github.com/skrmnghrdr/keyboardmacros/blob/main/Capslock%20as%20function.ahk

with some limitations to it

on this github repo above, 
https://github.com/Enilenis/CIDOO-QK61/tree/main/keyboards/cidoo/qk61/keymaps/via

here was the via folder located, overwrite the contents of that, and follow the compilation walkthrough on the repository. 

It should be good
hold esc and plug the keyboard to your computer
a directory (like a flash drive would appear)
drag and drop the .bin over there and it would install automatically

*profit?
